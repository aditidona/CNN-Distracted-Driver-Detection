## Convolutional-Neural-Network
-This is my whole learning on CNN. 
## Learning
- Adding maxpool layers to the sequential model
- Adding dropout layers to prevent overfitting
- Adding optimiser for updating the weights based on the loss function ( Back Propagation )
## Project: Distracted Driver Detection
  - Dataset : https://www.kaggle.com/c/state-farm-distracted-driver-detection/data
  - Build a keras sequential model to achieve maximum accuracy
  - Used Kaggle GPU to train the Neural NET
  - ### Accuracy Achieved:
      -Accuracy on Test Data : 99.5540
